# Diegoball
Diegoball is a high-risk game of skill.

## Pitch

The pitch must be kept up to rigorous specification. The diego-line should be exactly 99 inches from the grail.

The grail must be situated at the corner of two walls, where the walls are convex. The grail shall be secured to the corners to avoid excessive movement. Inside of the grail, 12 wooden blocks must be placed.

The sudden death marker (preferably a fruit sticker) must be situated halfway between the diego-line and grail.

## Scoring
There are three different ways to earn points:

- Block: if a block is knocked out of the grail, the player earns 1 point
- Temporary: if a marker goes into the grail but comes out, 2 points are awarded
- Permanent: if a marker stays in the grail, 10 points are awarded

## Game
A game consists of 3 sets. During a set, each player is issued 3 markers and has 3 tries to score. The player with the highest score at the end of the third set is declared the winner.

### Sudden death
If two or more players are tied for first place at the end of the third set, then sudden death is initiated.  Each player competing in sudden death must throw three markers from the sudden death marker. At the end of the sudden death set, the player with the highest sudden death score is declared the winner. Sudden death will continue until one player has scored more than the other sudden deaths player during a given set.
